## Introduction

The goal of these tutorials is to introduce the software tools developed to run the Autonomous Formulation Lab. We introduce our AI agent software (AFL.double_agent) and show how it can be used to build decision pipelines. The notebooks leverage widely used open source libraries (scikit-learn) and our new library for building decision pipelines (AFL.double_agent). We are in the process of developing tutorials for our orchestration software (AFL.automation) so check back soon

These tutorials are highly interactive, making it suitable for both self-paced learning and guided tutorial presentation settings.

## Background

The Autonomous Formulation Lab (AFL) is a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) program that seeks to accelerate the discovery and optimization of soft materials through the development and application of autonomous techniques to high-value measurements. Specifically, we design robotic platforms that autonomously mix, synthesize and evaluate soft materials and we study them using small-angle scattering (SANS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and other techniques.

## Instructions

No installation required! All tutorials are designed to run directly in Google Colab.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Google Colab Kernel Warning**: The Colab kernel will automatically disconnect after periods of inactivity. If this happens, you'll need to rerun the "Setup" section at the top of the notebook to continue your work.

### Notebook Versions
- **Student Notebooks**: These notebooks are designed for guided tutorial presentations. They have sections of the code removed that are meant to be filled in by the active participants.
- **Instructor Notebooks**: These notebooks are designed for self-paced learning. They contain all the code and can be used to work through the tutorial at your own pace.

### How to Use These Tutorials
1. Click the "Open in Colab" button for the notebook version you want to use
2. Make a copy of the notebook to your own Google Drive to save your work
3. Work through the tutorials in order (01 ‚Üí 02 ‚Üí Challenges)
